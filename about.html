        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>I made this website because I thought it would be cool to have a domain name. On it, I'm just hosting some stuff I find silly and some HTML tools that I "made" for myself.</p>
        <p>"Made" is in quotes because almost the entire website was generated by ChatGPT since I don't know how to code in HTML. I might re-make the website in the future myself, but I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>The aesthetic I was going for with this website was just trying to make it look as horrible as possible and be a graphic designer's nightmare.</p>
