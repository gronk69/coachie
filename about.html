        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>I only made this website because I wanted a domain name, I didn't think of what to put on the website until after I had bought the domain so it's kind of empty for now. I'm probbaly just gonna put a bunch of silly stuff or maybe tools I "made" for myself so they're easier for me to access.</p>
        <p>"Made" is in quotes because almost the entire website was generated by ChatGPT since I don't know how to code in HTML. I might re-make the website in the future myself, but I'm not sure on that.</p>
        <p>The aesthetic I was going for with the website is just making it look as absolutely horrible as I could.</p>
